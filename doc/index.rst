Account Invoice Consecutive Module
##################################


The Account Invoice Consecutive Module ensures new invoices do not have a date 
previous to the latest invoice in the sequence, as required by the law of some 
countries such as Spain.

The check is only applied to *customer* invoices and credit notes.

Important that invoice numbers are same number of characters. In invoice secuence
configuration add zeros in prefix to generate invoices numbers: Example:

 * 00001
 * 00002
 * ...
 * 00200
 * 00201
 * ...
