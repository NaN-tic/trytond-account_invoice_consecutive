Account Invoice Consecutive Module
##################################


The Account Invoice Consecutive Module ensures new invoices do not have a date 
previous to the latest invoice in the sequence, as required by the law of some 
countries such as Spain.

The check is only applied to *customer* invoices and credit notes.
